THIS GAME IS NOW COMPLETELY FREEWARE!
=====================================

In version 0.9, I planned to offer the possibility to become a
registered user and get special level series for registered users
only and some more things.

Now I have decided that it is better to distribute it as Freeware,
that means: Freely distributable, but still copyrighted software.
