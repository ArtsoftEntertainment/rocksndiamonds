NB's Introduction Levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

About
------
These levels are meant as an advanced tutorial, where (nearly) all of the
Rocks'n'Diamonds elements are introduced (with one exception; see below).

Each level contains either one or more associated new elements. Mostly there
is also an envelope explaining the new elements.

The only elements not present are gravitiy ports. Because gravity is
introduced not until the last level and they originally belong to Supaplex,
they simply didn't fit in anywhere ;)


Legal notes
------------
You may do anything with these levels as long as they or any derived work
of them are made available freely. If you however want to charge money for
derived work, please contact the author first.
