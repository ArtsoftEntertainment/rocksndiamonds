a while ago i went... "man, some of these rnd elements could use tutorials!"
specifically, things like emerald mine club and diamond caves 2 elements that
aren't in the current built-in tutorials. so i sat down and made some catchy,
fun tutorial levels for them.

that "while ago" was 2018-2019. 3 years later, in 2022, i return to unearth this
tutorial levelset. only 8 levels were finished despite plans for more, but it's
better to have these available than not at all.

the original version of this levelset included custom music from some modules
i liked. this music has been removed in the interest of keeping it copyright
friendly.

i hope to update this in the future (or make a separare tutorial) to cover more
advanced topics like player inventories, multiplayer, custom elements, and
group elements.
