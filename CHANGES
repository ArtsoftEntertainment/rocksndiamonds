Release Version 1.0 [9 APR 97]
------------------------------
	- the game now contains many really playable levels,
	  not only a few levels for testing
	- the game is now even better playable by keyboard
	  (now you have the same gameplay functionality
	  compared to playing with a joystick. Especially
	  there are diagonal directions with keyboard playing
	  and the fire buttons are mapped to the shift keys)
	- a lot of new elements for better emulation of levels
	  from the games "Boulderdash", "Emerald Mine" and
	  "Sokoban". New elements to build "Dynablaster" style
	  levels.
	- enhanced functionality of the level tape recorder
	  to make it possible to go on with a game at any tape
	  position

Prerelease Version 0.9b [4 NOV 95]
----------------------------------
	- the game is now completely Freeware
	- the game is now better playable by keyboard
	  (in the last version, the player was making more than
          one step for one keystroke in some cases -- thanks to
	  Warwick Allison for the hint with "XSync()"!)
	- new amoeba type with configurable content (like in the
	  original C64 version, when aboeba cannot grow anymore
	  and explodes to diamonds or some other elements)
	- compile error with ONE_PER_NAME in high score function
	  removed (thanks to Dmitry Kohmanyuk)
	- little code cleanup (to get some new bugs ;)
	- FreeBSD sound and joystick support (thanks to Jean-Marc
	  Zucconi)
