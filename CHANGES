Prerelease Version 0.9b [4 NOV 95]
------------------------------------
	- the game is now completely Freeware
	- the game is now better playable by keyboard
	  (in the last version, the player was making more than
          one step for one keystroke in some cases -- thanks to
	  Warwick Allison for the hint with "XSync()"!)
	- new amoeba type with configurable content (like in the
	  original C64 version, when aboeba cannot grow anymore
	  and explodes to diamonds or some other elements)
	- compile error with ONE_PER_NAME in high score function
	  removed (thanks to Dmitry Kohmanyuk)
	- little code cleanup (to get some new bugs ;)
	- FreeBSD sound and joystick support (thanks to Jean-Marc
	  Zucconi)

Prerelease Version 0.9 [23 OCT 95]
