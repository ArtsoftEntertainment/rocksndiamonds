The amoeba (first variant) grows randomly through empty space and sand.
When it is enclosed, it stops growing and transforms into diamonds (or
some other, configurable game element).

When it has grown too big, it suddenly transforms into rocks. At the beginning,
it can grow slowly, but after some time it starts growing very rapidly.
