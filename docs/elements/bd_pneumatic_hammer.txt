Sometimes diamonds or keys are buried in walls. You can use a pneumatic hammer
to break these walls, or simple walls which contain nothing. Stand on something,
and press the snap or drop key together with a left or right direction key to
use the hammer on a wall which is near the player, next to the element you
stand on.
