This is your player's look-alike. You must protect it against flies. If a
voodoo doll dies by one of them, your player also dies immediately. This doll
can have different properties: Sometimes it can collect diamonds for you.
Sometimes it must be protected from falling rocks. If it is hit by a rock, it
turns into a gravestone surrounded by steel walls. Also, it may or may not turn
into a gravestone by nearby explosions.
