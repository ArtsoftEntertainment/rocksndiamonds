===============================================================================
Compiling and installing Rocks'n'Diamonds
===============================================================================

To compile the game, you need the SDL library (version 2). In addition, you
also need the libraries SDL_image, SDL_mixer (with optional support for MOD,
MP3 and MIDI music) and SDL_net.

Please install these libraries before building Rocks'n'Diamonds.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux and other Unix systems (including Mac):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just run "make" to build the game.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows with gcc or MinGW (native or cross-compiling)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the game natively, just proceed as described above for Unix systems.

To cross-compile the game for Windows, run "cross-win32" or "cross-win64". You
probably have to adjust the path to the Windows cross-compiler defined in either
"CROSS_PATH_WIN32" or "CROSS_PATH_WIN64" in the top-level Makefile.


That's all!

If you have any comments, corrections or suggestions regarding the Makefiles,
please let me know at "info@artsoft.org". Thanks!
