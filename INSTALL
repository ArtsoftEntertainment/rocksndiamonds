WHAT TO DO TO INSTALL "ROCKS_N_DIAMONDS-0.9" ON YOUR SYSTEM
===========================================================

If you have a Linux system (Intel based, a.out, kernel 1.2.x), you
can use the precompiled binary.

If you have another Unix system, or an ELF system or just want to
compile the program by yourself, do the following:

Edit the file "Makefile" and set the following options:

XPM_INCLUDE_FILE	-	change this to the location where you
				have your XPM-Library include file.

				You must have the XPM-Library "libXpm"
				installed on your system to run this game.
				If you don't have it, look at your local
				FTP site with X11 archive to get it! :)

GAME_DIR		-	You can leave these values untouched
				if you use the default location for
				the game directory.
				If you want to move it to other places in
				your directory tree, just change them
				accordingly. (You can use symlinks instead,
				of course.)
				You might want to set GAME_DIR to the full
				path of the game in your file system, so
				you don't have to go to the game directory
				when you want to play it.

SOUNDS			-	If you never want to hear any sounds,
				set this to "-DNO_SOUNDS", but be warned:
				It's much less fun playing without sound! :)
				(The program detects by itself if it can
				play sounds or not, anyway.)

SCORE_ENTRIES		-	Set this to "-DONE_PER_NAME" if you want
				to allow only one entry per player in the
				score file for each level. This is useful
				if there are many players to prevent one
				single player to "flood" the Hall Of Fame
				of every level completely with his name...
				On single user systems, "-DMANY_PER_NAME"
				might be useful to have your name more
				than once in the list.

SYSTEM			-	If you have problems with the default
				settings, it might be useful to uncomment
				one of the defines for "SYSTEM" in the
				Makefile, which defines values like
				"-DSYSV" and something like that.

CC, INCL, LIBS		-	Set these ones to the appropriate values
				you usually use on your system to compile.


Now you can 'make clean' and 'make' and the game binary should be
compiled right out of the box. I have tested it with "-Wall" on my
system, so I hope that it compiles fine on other systems, too.

The program should compile and run on Linux (of course),
HP-UX, AIX, Net-BSD, SUN and IRIX.

Have fun!
