Installation instructions for Rocks'n'Diamonds
==============================================

Compilation
-----------

If your system supports Linux/i386/ELF/glibc executables (Linux package)
or if you run DOS/Windows (DOS package), you can directly use the included
precompiled binary.

If you use a different system, just recompile the game:

If you use Linux with gcc or DOS or Windows 3.x with djgpp, just try 'make'
which should work without problems.

If you use SUN/Solaris with gcc and GNU make, try 'make solaris'.

To build the game with SDL support (needed for fullscreen and MOD support),
type "make sdl". You need at least SDL version 1.1.x and the additional
SDL libraries SDL_image and SDL_mixer. To get a recent version of the SDL
library, see http://www.libsdl.org.

If the above doesn't work, edit the Makefile in the top level directory.
If it doesn't work either, edit the Makefile in the 'src' subdirectory.

If you had to modify any Makefile to compile it, please drop me a note
about it to 'info@artsoft.org'. Thanks!


Customization
-------------

The following configuration options in the top level Makefile help
you to customize the game to your system and your environment:

CC		Choose your favorite ANSI C compiler.
		Default is 'gcc'.

PLATFORM	Choose your platform, if auto detection fails.
		Auto detection should work for Linux and DOS
		(just type 'make'), on SUN/Solaris systems 'make solaris'
		should work. Other systems may need additional editing
		of 'src/Makefile' to set some additional compiler options.

X11_PATH	Specify the path to your X11 installation. Include files
		and libraries are searched for at $(X11_PATH)/include and
		$(X11_PATH)/lib, if you set this variables. If you don't
		set this variable, your compiler must be able to find X11
		by itself, which works fine for Linux, for example.

GAME_DIR	Specify the directory where the program looks for all the
		graphics, sounds, levels and high scores. If you leave this
		commented out, the current directory ('.') is used, which
		lets you use the game without installing it somewhere in
		your system (although you have to 'cd' to the game directory
		each time you want to play it).

JOYSTICK	Uncomment this line if your system does not support game
		port hardware like joysticks (and has therefore no joystick
		include file). Currently the game should work with joysticks
		on Linux and FreeBSD.

SOUNDS		Uncomment this line if your system does not support audio
		hardware. Currently the game should work with sound support
		on Linux, FreeBSD, SUN/Solaris, HP-UX and most Unix system
		that support '/dev/dsp' or '/dev/audio' devices.

SCORE_ENTRIES	Choose if you want to allow many entries in the high score
		table for one player or exactly one entry. Systems with a
		lot of users maybe want to limit high score entries to only
		one entry for each player (and therefore set 'SCORE_ENTRIES'
		to 'ONE_PER_NAME') where systems used by only one person
		maybe want to use the default of 'MANY_PER_NAME' which is
		automatically choosen if you leave everything commented out.

Modifications of the Makefile in the directory 'src' are normally not needed.
If the game fails to compile out of the box, you may have to modify some
of the system variables there to get it to compile.

SYSTEM		May need to be set to some system dependend values.

INCL, LIBS	Maybe some more directories for include files and libraries
		have to be added to this variables depending on your system.


If you have any comments, additions or modifications to the Makefile(s),
please send me mail: 'info@artsoft.org'. Thanks!
